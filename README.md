<h1>Java Swing Audio Player</h1>

<p>
This project is a simple audio player application developed using Java Swing. It features a basic graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons to <strong>Play</strong>, <strong>Reset</strong>, and <strong>Exit</strong> the audio playback. This project demonstrates the use of Java Swing components and the Java Sound API for media control.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Play</strong> – Starts or resumes audio playback</li>
  <li><strong>Reset</strong> – Restarts the audio from the beginning</li>
  <li><strong>Exit</strong> – Closes the application</li>
  <li>Built using Java Swing and event-driven programming</li>
</ul>

<h2> Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java Swing for GUI design</li>
  <li>Java Sound API for audio handling</li>
  <li>AWT Event Handling for button actions</li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes</h2>
<p>
Ensure that the path to the audio file is correct in the code, and that the audio format (e.g., WAV or AU) is supported by the Java Sound API. This project is ideal for beginners exploring Java GUI programming and basic audio functionality.
